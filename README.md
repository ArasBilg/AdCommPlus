# AdCommPlus
Modified client for the mobile game AdVenture Communist. Available on both iOS and Android. PC support coming soon.
Currently the only feature is no ads(Claim rewards instantly!)
AdComm+ is available for both non-jailbroken(.ipa) and jailbroken(.deb) and Android(.apk) versions
If you experience problems with the .deb version, report it in the Issues tab and use the .ipa with AppSync or TrollStore
until it's fixed. Although I searched many binaries and Objective-C files, I could not find a way to edit the currency values.
If you know how to edit the currencies, please contact me on Discord. My username is araspro. You will be credited.
The current AdComm version is 6.26.1, and the current AdComm+ version is 1.0.0
When HH releases a new update, I will update AdComm+ ASAP.
IMPORTANT: If using any of the iOS versions, AdComm+ will be installed next to the original AdComm, meaning you don't need to uninstall the original.
However, on an Android device, you will need to uninstall the original AdComm.
